# Interpreter Implementation Lab 2

# Note: This is a branch of the code before the implementation of the adjusted return behavior, in order to show the working implementation of Chapters 10 and 11 of Crafting Interpreters (based on our initial implementation of our code from Lab 1, meaning that this version is also capable of left shift, string multiplication, etc.)
